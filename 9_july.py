# Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
# Example 1:
# Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

# Solution:
def findFirstOccurrence(s: str, pattern: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    m = len(pattern)
    
    if m > n:
        return -1
    
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        if s[i:i + m] == pattern:
            return i
    
    return -1

# You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
# Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, 
# return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

# Solution:
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(flowerbed):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i-1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0):
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                count += 1
            i += 1
        
        return count >= n
