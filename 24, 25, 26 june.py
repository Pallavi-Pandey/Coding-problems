# Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. 
# Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. 
# The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# Return k.

# Solution :
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        pos = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num != val:
                nums[pos] = num
                pos += 1
        
        return pos


# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps

# Solution:
